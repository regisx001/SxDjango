# Web Application with Django, Django REST Framework, and SvelteKit

## Overview
This is a web application that is currently in the early development phase, built using **Django** for the backend, **Django REST Framework (DRF)** for API development, and **SvelteKit** for the frontend. The project will follow an **organized MVC architecture**, utilizing repositories and services for better code maintainability and scalability.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or any preferred database)
- **Others**: Docker (optional), Redis (if needed), Celery (for background tasks)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.8)
- Node.js (>= 16)
- PostgreSQL (or SQLite for local development)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/web-app.git
   cd web-app
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running with Docker
If you prefer a containerized environment, use Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
